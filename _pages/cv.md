Education
======
* M.S. in Electrical Engineering (Intelligent Systems, Robotics, and Controls), University of California - San Diego, 2024
* B.S. in Electrical Engineering (Machine Learning and Controls), University of California - San Diego, 2023

Work experience
======
* **NASA - Machine Learning Intern (June 2024 - August 2024)**
  * 
* **RoboCoach - Machine Learning Intern (May 2023 - May 2024)**
  * Designed and implemented an open-source project that automatically generates code based on natural language conversation in Python.
  * Integrated LangChain and OpenAI APIs to prompt multiple LLMs to implement the code generation mechanism in the application.
  * Developed custom prompts to maximize the quality of model output and utilized regular expressions to extract code from plain text.
  * Created a logging pipeline for recording user-model interactions for performance evaluation.
  * Streamlined user experience by developing a web-based user interface that resembles a chat bot with Streamlit.

* **Amazon Robotic - System Architecture Co-Op (July 2022 - September 2022)**
  * Designed test plans to gradually increase the complexity of tasks to match exit criteria for Proteus (Amazon’s first autonomous robot).
  * Wrote a series of Python scripts that utilized MySQL queries for an AWS database to automatically extract real-time data during testing.
  * Created a document to log all configurations during the testing of Proteus including SW, FW, HW, success rate, and map layout.
  * Initiated a cross-functional collaboration between the onboard SW team and data team to validate metrics and automate logging.

* **Takeda - Reliability Intern (June 2021 - September 2021)**
  * Served as the primary liaison between Takeda and the vendor for transitioning the facility from preventative to predictive maintenance.
  * Scheduled sensor installation, coordinating between the vendor and manufacturing teams to minimize production disruption.
  * Collaborated with departments to secure necessary approvals for temporary shutdowns, enabling smooth sensor deployment.
  * Contributed to a proposal for expanding predictive maintenance, securing funding for additional sensor installations in another building.
  * Highlighted operational redundancies to stakeholders, demonstrating the facility's ability to maintain production during sensor installation and potential equipment failures.
  * Performed a comprehensive cost analysis, clearly outlining the financial and operational benefits of adopting predictive maintenance practices.

* **SpaceX - Technician (July 2020 - October 2020)**
  * Developed and optimized the manufacturing process of solenoid valves to accelerate production and increase quality.
  * Increased production volume by 114% (from 70 to 150 valves/day).
  * Introduced two new steps in the assembly process to decrease assembly time (grease plating/poppet).
  * Root caused two major waves of valve failures that led to approximately 60 valves failing per day (swage tool/retainer cap/poppet).
  * Generated a step-by-step corrective action document for technicians to rectify production losses due to test failures.
