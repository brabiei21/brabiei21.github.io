Research Interests
======
I'm passionate about pushing the boundaries of robotics planning, localization, and mapping. Lately, I've been captivated by the idea of using large language models (LLMs) to revolutionize how robots plan and navigate. My current research dives into combining LLMs with linear temporal logics (LTLs), automatons, and semantic maps to create smarter, more autonomous robots. I‚Äôm excited about the potential to bring a new level of intelligence and adaptability to robotic systems!

Industry Experience
